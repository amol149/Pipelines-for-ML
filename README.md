				#Creating Pipelines using Scikit-Learn(Machine Learning) 

Benefits of Pipelines:

They make your workflow much easier to read and understand.

They enforce the implementation and order of steps in your project.

These in turn make your work much more reproducible.

In this post I am going to use a IRIS data set, which is inbilt dataset in python, to describe how the pipelines work and 
how to implement them.
Here I applied Logistic Regression-'LR', Decision Tree-'DT', 'Random Forest-'RF' and find its test accuracy.
Here Decision Tree is the Best classifier model and its accuracy is 91%
